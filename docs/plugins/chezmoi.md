# Chezmoi Plugin
## Overview
This plugin manages the configuration file for `chezmoi`, a dotfile manager. It preserves existing YAML formatting as much as possible while deep-merging settings.
## Prerequisites
- Windows only (if managing Windows paths), but cross-platform logic applies.
- `LOCALAPPDATA` must be set.
- The user must have permission to write to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\chezmoi\chezmoi.yaml`.
## Configuration Schema
The plugin accepts a top-level YAML object with a single supported field:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `settings` | object | none | Recursively merged into `chezmoi.yaml`. Any nested object shape is accepted. |
The plugin does not enforce a chezmoi-specific schema. It simply deep-merges the YAML object tree you provide.
### Merge behavior
- Objects are merged recursively.
- Non-object values replace the existing value.
- New keys are added.
- If the current file is missing, the plugin starts from an empty object.
## Usage Examples
### Minimal update
```yaml
settings:
  data:
    email: "user@example.com"
```
### Nested settings update
```yaml
settings:
  data:
    email: "user@example.com"
    name: "John Doe"
  diff:
    command: "code"
    args: ["--wait", "--diff"]
```
## Verification Steps
1. Confirm `chezmoi` is installed.
2. Apply your configuration.
3. Open `%LOCALAPPDATA%\chezmoi\chezmoi.yaml`.
4. Verify the expected nested keys were added or updated.
5. Run `chezmoi data` or similar commands and confirm the setting appears.
## Notes / Caveats
- The plugin never validates whether a key is a real chezmoi option.
- Because merging is recursive, providing a partial object only changes the matching subtree.
- Dry runs are controlled by the execution context, not by a YAML field.
