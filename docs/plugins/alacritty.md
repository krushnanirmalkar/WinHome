# Alacritty Plugin
## Overview
This plugin manages the Alacritty terminal emulator configuration file. It preserves existing TOML formatting as much as possible while merging settings.
## Prerequisites
- Windows only (if managing Windows paths), but cross-platform logic applies.
- `APPDATA` must be set.
- The user must have permission to write to `%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml`.
## Configuration Schema
The plugin accepts a top-level YAML object with a single supported field:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `settings` | object | none | Recursively merged into `alacritty.toml`. Any nested object shape is accepted. |
The plugin does not enforce an Alacritty-specific schema. It simply deep-merges the TOML object tree you provide.
### Merge behavior
- Objects are merged recursively.
- Non-object values replace the existing value.
- New keys are added.
- If the current file is missing, the plugin starts from an empty object.
## Usage Examples
### Minimal update
```yaml
settings:
  window:
    padding:
      x: 10
      y: 10
```
### Nested settings update
```yaml
settings:
  font:
    normal:
      family: "Cascadia Code"
    size: 11.0
  colors:
    primary:
      background: "#282c34"
      foreground: "#abb2bf"
```
## Verification Steps
1. Confirm Alacritty is installed.
2. Apply your configuration.
3. Open `%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml`.
4. Verify the expected nested keys were added or updated.
5. Launch Alacritty and confirm the setting appears or takes effect.
## Notes / Caveats
- The plugin never validates whether a key is a real Alacritty option.
- Because merging is recursive, providing a partial object only changes the matching subtree.
- Dry runs are controlled by the execution context, not by a YAML field.
