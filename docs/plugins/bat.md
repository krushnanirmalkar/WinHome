# Bat Plugin
## Overview
This plugin manages the configuration file for `bat`, a syntax-highlighting pager. It reads and writes the `config` file as a series of key=value pairs or standalone flags.
## Prerequisites
- Windows only (if managing Windows paths), but cross-platform logic applies.
- `APPDATA` must be set.
- The user must have permission to write to `%APPDATA%\bat\config`.
## Configuration Schema
The plugin accepts a top-level YAML object with a single supported field:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `settings` | object | none | Merged into `bat/config`. Each key/value pair is mapped directly to a command-line flag format in the file. |
The plugin does not validate `bat` configuration options. It simply writes the keys and values you provide.
### Merge behavior
- Non-object values replace the existing value for the given key.
- New keys are added.
- If a value is a boolean `true`, the key is written as a bare flag (e.g. `--italic-text`).
- If a value is a boolean `false`, the flag is removed.
## Usage Examples
### Minimal update
```yaml
settings:
  "--theme": "TwoDark"
```
### Multiple flags
```yaml
settings:
  "--theme": "TwoDark"
  "--style": "numbers,changes,header"
  "--italic-text": true
```
## Verification Steps
1. Confirm `bat` is installed.
2. Apply your configuration.
3. Open `%APPDATA%\bat\config`.
4. Verify the expected flags were added or updated.
5. Run `bat` on a file and confirm the visual changes apply.
## Notes / Caveats
- The plugin never validates whether a key is a real `bat` flag.
- Dry runs are controlled by the execution context, not by a YAML field.
